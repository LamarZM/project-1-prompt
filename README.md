//As a beginner, I had received tons of help by one of the instructors. He had drawn me a layout of how I would construct my HTML to get my project working. From that point on, I've tried to get as much done on my own with the HTML, CSS, and JQuery, but would still refer back for further help. I started with the HTML, the main asset to creating the game, then i carried on to the CSS for styling the HTML, and last but not least I had worked on the JQuery to get my game functioning.
